//  The first line of code assigns the port number you’ll use for this application: 3000.
const port = 3000;

// Then you use require to import a specific Node.js module called http and save it as a constant.
const http = require("http");

// You also require the http-status-codes package to provide constants representing HTTP status codes.
const httpStatus = require("http-status-codes");


// Next, you use the http variable as a reference to the HTTP module to create a server, using that module’s createServer function, and store the resulting server in a variable called app.
const app = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    // You log that a request was received from the client.
    console.log("Received an incoming request!");

    // The first line uses a writeHead method to define some basic properties of the response’s HTTP header.
    // HTTP headers contain fields of information that describe the content being transferred in a request or response.
    // In this case, you’re returning httpStatus.OK, which represents a 200 response code, and an HTML content-type to indicate that the server received a request successfully and will return content in the form of HTML.

    let responseMessage = "<h1>Hello, Universe!</h1>";

    // Right below that line, you’re writing a line of HTML in the response with write and closing the response with end. You must end your response with end to tell the server that you’re no longer writing content. Not doing so leaves the connection with the client open, preventing the client from receiving the response.
    response.write(responseMessage);
    response.end();

    // You also log your response at this point so you can see that a response was sent from the server itself.
    console.log(`Sent a response : ${responseMessage}`);
});

// The last line of code takes the server instance, app, and runs the listen method to indi cate that the server is ready for incoming requests at port 3000.
app.listen(port);
console.log(`The server has started and is listening on port number:
➥ ${port}`);
